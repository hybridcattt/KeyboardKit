# Understanding Callouts

This article describes the KeyboardKit callout engine.

Input and action callouts are important parts of the typing experience, where input callouts show the currently pressed key and action callouts present secondary keyboard actions.

In KeyboardKit, a ``CalloutActionProvider`` can be used to provide secondary actions to an ``Callouts/ActionCallout``, which in turn will update views like ``Callouts/ActionCallout``.

KeyboardKit will bind a ``StandardCalloutActionProvider`` to ``KeyboardInputViewController/calloutActionProvider`` when the keyboard is loaded. It has no callout actions by default, but you can add localized providers to it or replace it with a custom implementation at any time.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks localized action providers for all keyboard locales when you register a valid license. Information about Pro features can be found at the end of this article.


## Callout namespace

KeyboardKit has a ``Callouts`` namespace that contains callout-specic types and views, except protocols and contexts.

For instance, a ``Callouts/InputCallout`` shows the currently pressed key while a ``Callouts/ActionCallout`` shows secondary actions when long pressing a key. These callouts are automatically used if you use a ``SystemKeyboard``.


## How to show input and action callouts

You can apply callout-specific view extensions in KeyboardKit, to make any view act as the container of input and action callouts. 

For instance, this will make your custom keyboard view show both input and action callouts:

```swift
MyKeyboard()
    .keyboardCalloutContainer(...)
```

This view extension will bind a ``CalloutActionContext`` and a ``CalloutInputContext`` to the view, and create ``Callouts/ActionCallout`` and ``Callouts/InputCallout`` views that will show as these contexts change. 

The ``SystemKeyboard`` and ``KeyboardButton/Button`` will automatically update these contexts as you interact with a button.


## How to customize callout actions

You can customize the callout actions by adding localized providers to the default ``StandardCalloutActionProvider``, or by replacing ``KeyboardInputViewController/calloutActionProvider`` with a custom ``CalloutActionProvider``.


## How to create a custom callout action provider

You can create a custom ``CalloutActionProvider`` by either inheriting the ``StandardCalloutActionProvider`` base class and customize the parts you want, or implement the ``CalloutActionProvider`` protocol from scratch.

You can also inherit the ``BaseCalloutActionProvider`` base class to get a bunch of convenience functionality for free.

For instance, here is a custom provider that inherits ``StandardCalloutActionProvider`` and customizes the secondary actions for the `$` key:

```swift
class CustomCalloutActionProvider: StandardCalloutActionProvider {
    
    // This function is the most convenient to override
    override func calloutActionString(for char: String) -> String {
        switch char {
        case "$": return "$â‚½Â¥â‚¬Â¢Â£â‚©"
        default: return super.calloutActionString(for: char)
        }
    }
}
```

To use this provider instead of the standard one, just set ``KeyboardInputViewController/calloutActionProvider`` to this custom provider:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        calloutActionProvider = CustomCalloutActionProvider()
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }
}
```

This will make KeyboardKit use your custom implementation instead of the standard one.


## ðŸ‘‘ Pro features

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks localized ``CalloutActionProvider`` implementations for all ``KeyboardLocale``s in your license and automatically injects them into the ``StandardCalloutActionProvider``.

You can access all and locale-specific providers like this:

```swift
let providers = License.current.localizedCalloutActionProviders
let provider = try ProCalloutActionProvider.Swedish()
```

If you want to use a custom provider with KeyboardKit Pro, make sure to register it *after* registering your license key, otherwise it will be overwritten by the license registration process.

For instance, this is how you would register the custom provider that we created earlier, using the localized providers from your license:

```swift
open func setupKeyboardKit() {
    try? setupPro(withLicenseKey: key, view: keyboardView) { license in
        self.setupCustomServices(with: license)
    }
}

func setupCustomServices(with license: License) {
    calloutActionProvider = CustomCalloutActionProvider(
        keyboardContext: keyboardContext,
        localizedProviders: license.localizedCalloutActionProviders
    )
}
```

You can add a custom initializer to your custom provider if you need any additional setup.
