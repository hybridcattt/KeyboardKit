# Release notes

KeyboardKit tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Deprecations can happen at any time.
* Deprecated code will only be removed in `major` versions.
* Breaking changes should not happen in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Breaking changes can still occur in minor versions and BETA features, if the alternative is to not be able to release new critical features or fixes.

These release notes will only contain the current version. Just check out an older branch or version tag to access older release notes. 



## 8.0

This version removes all previously deprecated functions and aims to make the library cleaner by moving types into namespaces.

The goal with all these new namespaces is to increase discoverability and make it easier to overview the different parts of the library.

As a result, some nice-to-have utilities have been removed, if their existence bloated the library while providing little value.

Note that the library no longer sets up English services by default, so make sure that you are aware of that before upgrading. 

You must either implement these services yourself, or get them by upgrading to KeyboardKit Pro.

### ðŸš¨ Important changes
